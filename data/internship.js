            Not much - I took AP CS in high school and didn’t learn a ton, and when
            I applied to be an intern I was taking CS 31.

            My favorite memory is the first meeting we had for the learning lab
            I was working on. At the time, it seemed really scary to be thrown
            into a project with not a lot of experience, but looking back on it
            I’m proud of how much I learned since then.

            I only knew basic programming (CS31) level when I became an intern.

            Yes, I’m the design director for TeachLA and I’m also getting
            involved in Design starting fall!

            If you’re on the fence about applying because you think you don’t
            have enough experience or you don’t feel like you belong in CS
            culture, I would give it a shot anyways! You might surprise
            yourself.
