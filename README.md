Hey there! This repo contains all of the code for ACM @ UCLA's front-facing website, which you can view at [uclaacm.com](https://uclaacm.com) or at [acm.cs.ucla.edu](https://acm.cs.ucla.edu). You can find out more about our organization, the events we hold, and all the different committees within ACM!

Our website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) on top of [React](https://reactjs.org), with a style and [design system](https://design.uclaacm.com) internally developed by our dev team and [ACM Design](https://design.uclaacm.com). The site is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/); we're grateful for their support in the open-source program. Under the hood, we use both [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to lint our JS and CSS code respectively.

## Notes for Developers

### Design Guidelines

*Doc coming soon!*

Have questions about the overarching project of this website, like:

* what technologies do we use?
* what are our code writing styles?
* where should I add ___ file?
* what method would I do to make a ___?

Check out our project design doc for more information!

### Development Setup

We'll follow a very traditional [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) project setup. Before we start, make sure that you have the LTS version of Node (currently ~ `14.x`) and a copy of [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer.

First, we'll clone the repo and install all of our dependencies. You only need to do this once.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/uclaacm/website.git
...
$ cd website
$ npm install
```

Our app's development and build cycle is managed by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/); so, we can just run `npm start` to serve our app:

```sh
$ npm start

> acm-website@0.1.0 start /Users/matt/code/acm-website
> next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000

event - compiled successfully
```

This should automatically open up a window in your browser with our website; if it doesn't, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Note that `next dev` ships with ["Fast Refresh"](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) (their version of hot module reloading), so every time you modify a file, the app will automatically recompile and reload!

### Contribution Workflow

Want to make a change to the website? Great! Here are the steps:

1. Either make a new branch or a fork of this repository. `main` is a protected branch, **so you cannot push to it**.
2. Follow the instructions in "Development Setup" above. If you're on a fork, replace the URL with the fork's URL; if you're on a different branch, check it out using `git checkout`.
3. Make your changes!
4. **Before you push**, make sure your app builds with `npm run build`. If there are any errors, our CI/CD service will **reject your build**.
5. Once you're ready, stage and commit your changes!
6. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/uclaacm/website/pulls) with your changes, and let someone on the dev team know.
7. If your code passes code review, we'll merge it into `main`. Congratulations! If you'd like, it's now safe to delete your branch/fork.

### Production Deploy

We currently deploy our site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which handles both our deploy previews and our production deploy. To use Netlify properly with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), we use Netlify's first-party [Essential Next.js](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs) plugin. Because Netlify typically only deploys static sites, this plugin allows us to use Next's SSR features, as well as other runtime behaviours like image optimization.

As a note, we've been running into some problems with `next/image` working properly - that's why some parts of the codebase stil use the `<img />` tag. It's likely that these problems have to do with a misconfiguration/misuse of the Netlify plugin, or a lack of feature parity surrounding runtime image optimization.

The CD pipeline is also mimicked in GitHub Actions. To ensure that your build passes production deploy, ensure that `npm run build` passes; you should get something like:

```sh
$ npm run build

> acm-website@0.1.0 build /Users/matt/code/acm-website
> next build

○  (Static)  automatically rendered as static HTML (uses no initial props)
●  (SSG)     automatically generated as static HTML + JSON (uses getStaticProps)
   (ISR)     incremental static regeneration (uses revalidate in getStaticProps)
```

Outside of image optimization, the rest of our site is SSG'd by Next. In other words, after build-time, you should expect a fully-functional site (barring image serving).

## Notes on Previous Iterations

From (some time) to 2019, this website had a more involved build system, still using React but also managing our webpack configuration, ESLint, containerization with Docker, and deploying on Heroku.

In mid-2020, we made two larger changes:

* we followed [ACM Design's](https://design.uclaacm.com) new **Branding 3.0** design system, reworking the visual language of the site
* we moved away from a custom webpack configuration and containerization deployed on Heroku to using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) deployed on Netlify, with the main goal of reducing development burden and taking advantage of static-site deployers

In mid-2021, we made another set of changes surrounding performance and robustness:

* we swapped out Create React App for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), with the goal of using the hybrid SSG + SSR/ISR model to deliver better performance and SEO-friendly pages
* some more stuff coming soon :)
